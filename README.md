The Memory Card Game
A card game written in C.<pre>
</pre>
Here are the rules: 
• There are 2 players and they take turns to play.
• During a player’s turn, the player picks 2 cards. If the values of the cards are the same (ignoring
the suits), the player wins those cards and gains an extra turn (this continues until the values
don’t match). Otherwise, it is the other player’s turn.
• Continue taking turns until all cards are won. Then whoever has the most cards wins. Note that
it is possible to have a tie (both players win 26 cards).
